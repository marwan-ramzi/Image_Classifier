# AI Programming with Python Project

Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project, students first develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application.

#Developer: Marwan Ramzi

I am developing the code for now. I'll be using this dataset of 102 flower categories.
Link for the dataset: https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html

AWS DeepRacer Student
Get started by learning the fundamentals of ML:
- Lesson 1: Introduction to machine learning.
- Lesson 2: Introduction to reinforcement learning.

Creating and training model for the AWS DeepRacer Student League Regular Season.

I finished 3 tasks:
- Finishing the Lessons
- Passing the test.
- Training the model and modifying the reward function code to finish 3 laps of the track under 3 minutes.

Learining about different model parameters to use them correctly in the reward function (Can be found in Pre_Season_Race).
I used PPO policy for the model.
I managed to finish in 2 minutes and 40 seconds.
