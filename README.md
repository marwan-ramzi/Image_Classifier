# AI Programming with Python Project

Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project, students first develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application.

#Developer: Marwan Ramzi

I am developing the code for now. I'll be using this dataset of 102 flower categories.
